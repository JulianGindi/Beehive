# BeeHive

BeeHive was created to serve a single basic purpse; to allow users to find the things they love on the internet and store them in a centralized location. BeeHive is based on simplicity and ease of use. While not currently in the feature set, BeeHive will eventually give users the option to make their list "public" and share it with their friends. 

# Development

The development of BeeHive can be seen in commit histories but also through BeeHive's development [blog](http://beehivedev.tumblr.com/). It will begin to be updated with upcoming features and any issues that may arise.
